# Gauss and Jacobi Methods for parallel processing.

This repository contains an investigation into Gauss-Seidel and Jacobi itterative methods for parallel computing. 

Both solutions are written in C with the source of the investigation found **[here](https://github.com/Mike-In-The-Cloud/gauss-and-jacobi/tree/main/code)**. A **[report](https://github.com/Mike-In-The-Cloud/gauss-and-jacobi/blob/main/Report.pdf)** for this investigations has also been provided.
